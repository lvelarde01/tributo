	       	<h3>Brief Biography of the young Jeff Bezos: tenacity, work and vision of the future</h3>
	       	<p>As you will see in this brief review of his biography, Jeff Bezos did not have a particularly easy life at the beginning. In fact, much of his success must be attributed to his hard work, unwavering determination and, of course, his unparalleled vision for the future. </br>
	       		Veamos cómo consiguió llegar a la posición que ocupa actualmente.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Origin, adoption abd childhood:¿Were the bezos spanish ?</h3>
	       	<p>Jeff Bezos was born in 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the son of teenage parents (17 and 19 years old). Also, shortly after his birth, they divorced.<br>

			In 1968, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos, who would later adopt Jeff. Thus, his name went from the initial Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen to the now famous Jeffrey "Jeff" Preston Bezos.<br>

			Interestingly, the surname Bezos has Spanish origin: grandfather Salvador Bezos was born in a town in Valladolid, Villafrechós, before emigrating to the Caribbean island. In fact, Bezos himself visited this Castilian town in 2011, looking for the roots of his paternal family.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Origin, adoption abd childhood:¿Were the bezos spanish ?</h3>
	       	<p>In the early years of Jeff's life, the Bezos family moved from New Mexico to Houston, where Jeff did much of his elementary schooling. Later, a new transfer would take them to Miami, where Bezos attended high school.<br>

			His part-time job at a McDonald's did not prevent him from getting great grades at this educational stage. In this way, being the student with the best grades, he was responsible for delivering the graduation speech of his institute.<br>

			Interestingly, already in that speech he pointed to what would be one of his great passions: space travel.<br>

			Although he had to wait many years, his recent space adventure (through his company Blue Origin) allowed him to make that adolescent dream come true.<br>

			Without a doubt, this is just one more example of the vision and determination that have always characterized him.<br>

			Finally, Jeff Bezos completed his university studies at the prestigious Princeton University. There he graduated in 1986 in Electrical and Computer Engineering with the highest possible qualification: summa cum laude.</p>

	       	<h3>Jeff Bezos: Academic Studies</h3>
	       	<p>In the early years of Jeff's life, the Bezos family moved from New Mexico to Houston, where Jeff did much of his elementary schooling. Later, a new transfer would take them to Miami, where Bezos attended high school.<br>

			His part-time job at a McDonald's did not prevent him from getting great grades at this educational stage. In this way, being the student with the best grades, he was responsible for delivering the graduation speech of his institute.<br>

			Finally, Jeff Bezos completed his university studies at the prestigious Princeton University. There he graduated in 1986 in Electrical and Computer Engineering with the highest possible qualification: summa cum laude.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Pofessional beginnings</h3>
	       	<p>Although his training had been purely technical, Bezos began his working life in the financial field.<br>

			Thus, his first job was at a start-up in the fintech sector: Fitel. Shortly after, he fully entered the banking sector, working as a product manager for Bankers Trust, where he remained between 1988 and 1990.<br>

			From 1990 to 1994, Bezos worked for a New York hedge fund: D. E. Shaw & Co. His talent and ability to work led him to the position of fourth senior vice president at just 30 years old.<br>

			Undoubtedly, this experience in the world of finance and investment was key to his future business adventure, providing him with a background that would help him overcome all kinds of difficulties.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Entrepreneur Bezos: Amazon, Blue Origin abd much more.</h3>
	       	<p>Indeed, his technical background and experience in finance gave Jeff Bezos a unique vision and ability to undertake his own projects.<br>
				Let's see how he knew how to take advantage of them to revolutionize an entire industry and become the richest person in the world.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Amazon Bright Idea: How to be the best at Ecommerce.</h3>
	       	<p>In 1994, while working at the hedge fund, Jeff Bezos came across a fact that changed his life forever: the Internet was growing at a rate of 2,300% per year.<br>

			His financial experience and his vision for the future immediately made her think that this was a unique opportunity.<br>

			In this way, he decided to give up his job security to embark on a career path that would make history.<br>

			Thus, on July 5, 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage, establishing the headquarters in the dynamic city of Seattle. As the saying goes, "the rest is history."<br>

			The first name of this company was Cadabra, but it was soon changed to Amazon. It sounded better and appeared better positioned in the aggregators and web listings of the time, which were based on alphabetical order.<br>

			As you know, Amazon was born as an online bookstore, although with a huge assortment. However, Bezos always had in mind to expand the idea to other sectors. In this sense, today Amazon sells almost everything, with overwhelming success. Sometimes he does it by creating new departments from scratch and other times, as in the case of the magnificent Audible (which I use daily to "read" investment books), by acquiring other companies.<br>

			Thus, among many other products, electronic devices stand out (with its Kindle e-book in a prominent place), food supplies, music in digital format, clothing and dozens of other categories.<br>

			With Amazon Studios, the company also entered fully into audiovisual production.<br>

			Furthermore, its infrastructure has facilitated the creation of many other businesses around it. Today, anyone can sell on Amazon. It is even possible to self-publish your own books. In fact, I used your wonderful platform to edit mine: Investing: Keys to Financial Freedom.<br>

			Despite all these successes of the company, on July 5, 2021, Jeff Bezos left the first line of management in order to dedicate more time to other projects. Therefore, on that date he ceased to be the CEO of Amazon to become executive president.</p>
       </div>
        <div>
	       	<h3>Some figures about Amazon.</h3>
	       	<p>Despite many ups and downs and some fierce initial competition with the big bookstore chains Barnes & Noble and Borders, Amazon managed to overcome all the problems to become the behemoth it is today.<br>

			But let's see some figures, to know exactly what we are talking about:<br></p>

			<ul>
       			<li>As of today (December 2021), Amazon's market cap is $1.73 trillion. There are estimates that indicate that it could be the first company to reach 3 billion dollars in the coming years.</li>	
       			<li>Amazon had net income of 386,060 million dollars in 2020. In fact, during the COVID health crisis, it boosted its sales to record figures, absolutely unprecedented in the industry</li>	
       			<li>For its shareholders, Amazon has also been an incredibly profitable investment. In fact, this is the oldest asset in my personal portfolio, since I bought my first shares of the company in 2009, which I have later reinforced with additional purchases.</li>	
       		</ul>

       		<p>To give you an idea of the spectacular growth of its price, I leave you this revealing graph:<br></p>

		      alt="Grafico"
		    />
		    <p>As you have seen, the economic success of Amazon is indisputable.<br><br>
				Its dominant position in the electronic commerce sector allows it to generate large profits that are reflected in the evolution of its shares on the American stock market.<br>

       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Amazon Web Server.</h3>
	       	<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary company of Amazon that, to this day, is one of Jeff Bezos' most profitable businesses. Not in vain did it generate revenue of 46,000 million dollars in 2020 alone.<br>
			Although it may not sound familiar to you, AWS technology is behind the operation of many web pages and large communication networks.<br>
			Thus, in addition to thousands of other clients, entities such as NASA or the CIA and companies as prominent as Netflix or Coca Cola have trusted Amazon Web Services.<br>
			Among other services, AWS provides cloud storage, database technology, machine learning tools, data analytics, etc.</p>
       </div>
        <div>
	       	<h3>Blue Origin: a dream comme true.</h3>
	       	<p>As we have seen, the teenage Bezos was fascinated by the subject of space travel. Once again, his tenacity and determination led him to fulfill that youthful dream several decades later.<br>
			In 2000, Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin, dedicated to the manufacture and operation of aerospace vehicles.<br>
			After many years of silent work, it was in July 2021 that this company became known worldwide, thanks to its successful first space mission. Bezos himself was part of the crew of this flight, thus seeing one of his greatest aspirations fulfilled since he was 18 years old.<br><br>
			If you are interested, here you can see the complete recording of the flight:</p>

	       	<h3>¿Why not buy a newspaper? The Washington Post and other investments.</h3>
	       	<p>Jeff Bezos' entrepreneurial spirit seems to know no bounds.<br>
			In this sense, his eagerness to diversify investments and start new adventures led him to acquire The Washington Post newspaper in 2013. The operation amounted to 250 million dollars.<br>
			On the other hand, Bezos also created a venture capital investment company: Bezos Expeditions. Through this investment vehicle, the former CEO of Amazon has developed important bets for companies such as Airbnb, Basecamp, Twitter, Uber or Blue Origin itself.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>Jeff Bezos: fortune philanthropy and some controversy.</h3>
	       	<p>Jeff Bezos is estimated to have a net worth of $200 billion as of today (December 2021). As we said, this places him as the richest person in the world.<br>
				This fortune has allowed Bezos to undertake different charitable actions in all kinds of areas. Although this facet of him is not usually highlighted, he has topped the list of the 50 largest philanthropists in the United States in 2020, with a contribution of 10.15 billion dollars in that year alone.<br>
				His Day 1 Fund initiative also allows him to contribute funds to all kinds of charities that support disadvantaged families. Thus, he has made donations worth 105.9 million dollars throughout the year 2020.<br>
				However, Jeff Bezos has distanced himself from the Giving Pledge initiative, promoted by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, so that the great billionaires donate a substantial part of his fortune.<br>
				Perhaps this fact has unfairly overshadowed the important charitable facet of the entrepreneur.<br>
				Other controversies that have affected Bezos have been the controversial working conditions that were applied to some of his employees, as well as several conflicts with the press. On the other hand, his divorce also made rivers of ink run in all the media.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
	       	<h3>¿What can we learn from Jeff Bezos?.</h3>
	       	<p>Some of the most important lessons we can learn from Jeff Bezos' trajectory are the following:<br><br></p>
	       	<ul>
       			<li>Forward-looking: Bezos has proven time and time again his impressive ability to anticipate trends and lead the way in different areas of business. He saw the potential of e-commerce with Amazon before anyone else, created AWS to provide services that would prove essential to the growth of the internet, and founded Blue Origin to try to lead a really promising industry.</li>	
       			<li>Determination and hard work: without a doubt, it would be impossible to reach the heights of success of Jeff Bezos without a huge dose of hard work and determination. Despite the many enemies or detractors of him, this is an indisputable virtue.</li>	
       			<li>Calculated risks and diversification: As you have seen, Bezos has invested in all kinds of businesses throughout his career. However, he has never done it impulsively or "putting all your eggs in one basket." In this sense, his investment style differs a lot from that of other great entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk.</li>	
       		</ul>
       		<p>Therefore, these are teachings fully applicable to the world of investment, regardless of the volume of capital you have to build your portfolio.</p>
       </div>
        <div>
	       	<h3>[Pesonal Opinion] ¿who is Jeff Bezos to me?</h3>
	       	<p>As I have already told you, Amazon shares are the ones I have had in my portfolio for the longest time, since I acquired them in 2009. To this day, I continue to hold them and have extended my position on several occasions.<br>
				This simple fact can give you an idea of ​​my confidence in the Jeff Bezos project and, once again, in his incredible vision for the future.<br><br>
				But there is more.<br><br>
				And it is that, as you have seen in the previous section, Bezos's philosophy as an entrepreneur and investor is a continuous source of inspiration for me. In this way, perseverance and determination, together with a good diversification in businesses with the capacity to generate profits, are fantastic guides for any investor.<br><br>
				On the other hand, the versatility of Amazon to open up new business opportunities accessible to everyone never ceases to fascinate me.<br>
				In fact, there are many ways to generate income thanks to Amazon.<br>
				If, in addition to what I comment on in this post, you are interested in me covering more topics about how passive income can be generated through the internet, do not forget to indicate it to me in the comments.<br>
				Finally, if you want to know more about the history of Jeff Bezos and the creation of Amazon, I recommend you read the very interesting book Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon. It sure won't let you down.<br><br>
				Until the next article, I wish you a very happy investment!</p>
